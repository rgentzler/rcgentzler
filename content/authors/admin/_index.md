My work aims to build a fairer, more effective legal system by fusing a people-centered approach to justice with the power of data and research. At the [Oklahoma Policy Institute](https://www.okpolicy.org), I started [Open Justice Oklahoma](https://openjustice.okpolicy.org/), a program that collects, analyzes, and communicates data on the state's courts, jails, and prisons. I'm currently Data Innovations Director at [Fair and Just Prosecution](https://www.fairandjustprosecution.org), working with reform-minded prosecutors' offices around the country to tell their stories and measure their impact.

I love using R to uncover patterns in messy administrative data, revealing things that challenge our ideas about how the world works.
