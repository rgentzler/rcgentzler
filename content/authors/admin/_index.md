I'm the Research Director at the [Oklahoma Policy Institute](https://www.okpolicy.org), overseeing the organization's work to leverage data in support of our policy and programmatic goals. Previously with OK Policy, I served as the Director of [Open Justice Oklahoma](https://openjustice.okpolicy.org/) and as Criminal Justice Policy Analyst.

Over the last five years, I've built tools to collect various public data sets, a database to store them, and various interactive data visualizations to communicate our findings. I love using R to uncover patterns in messy administrative data, revealing things that confirm and - even better - challenge our ideas about how the world works.
